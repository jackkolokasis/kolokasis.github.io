  I am a 3rd-year PhD student in the <Computer Science Department at the
  University of Crete, working with <a href="https://users.ics.forth.gr/~bilas">Prof. Angelos Bilas</a>. 
  I am also a graduate research assistant in the <a
  href="https://www.ics.forth.gr/carv/">Institute of Computer Science (ICS)</a> 
  at the <a href="https://www.forth.gr/">Foundation of Research and Technology -
  Hellas (FORTH)</a>. I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer
  Science from the University of Crete in 2017 and 2020, respectively. My main
  research interests fall at the intersection of managed programming languages
  and runtimes, memory, and storage systems. My work focuses on exploiting
  emerging non-volatile memories and fast block-addressable storage devices to
  improve heap efficiency in managed languages for data warehouse workloads,
  such as big-data analytics frameworks. My recent work resolves the tension
  between garbage collection and serialization/deserialization by providing a
  separate scanless managed heap over storage devices. It eliminates both
  garbage collection and serialization overheads without imposing any language
  restrictions.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
